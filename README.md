Stephen Stardellis: 

This project shows a sample webpage about myself with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application to creating the page. 
It contains two pages, one call 'index.html' to introduce myself and another called 'hobby.html' to allow you to show your interests for movies since its one of my hobbies.
Additionally, there are two more files called 'styles.css' to help style the webpages and 'navbar.js' to create a simple animation when hovering over the navigation bar.
Through this project, I was able to engage and build upon my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added several styles to the styles.css file.

nav - made the navigation bar organized horizontally, rounded, centered, hover effect, and fit the color pallete. Additionally, fixed the first and last components to work with the rounded borders when hovering.
body - I chose a lighter blue (#6CC1D9) for my background color and used 'Roboto Slab' as my font.

h1, h2 - Both have similar styling, just adjusted font size, alignment, and spacing.

table - table has hovering effect and adjusted the color to match the pallete.

p - Simple centering and sizing of the font, using white as the text color.

.courses - Faced a challenge when trying to only modify the courses list. Modified the list of courses without modifying the navbar list by using a class. This includes creating a rounded border with background color and hover effect.

textarea - Allowed only the text area part of the form to move vertically.

form - Centering and aligning the area of the whole form. Added rounded borders.

footer - Added basic color and sizing adjustments for styling up the footer.

html, body - Had a small issue with the footer being off centered slightly, so margin was reset to 0.

- **Simple JavaScript Animation**: Made it so that when you hover over a section on the navigation bar, the section becomes 1.3x when hovering. It returns to normal size after mouse moves away.

- **List of Semantics Tags Used**:

index.html - header, footer, main, nav, summary, link, image, and section (total of 8 different)

hobby.html - header, footer, main, nav, link, and section (total of 6 different)

### Design Achievements

- **Color Pallette**: I chose a diverse shade of blue colors to design my website. The color pallette screenshot is included in this repository.

- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto Slab as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
